# easterlies-collaborative-project

A collaborative project to work on the ACCESS-OM2-01 Antarctic easterly perturbation simulations. This is a central repository where we can work on analysis scripts together, suggest new analysis directions, discuss figures etc.

## How it works
All aspects of the project are tracked through issues. Create an issue to represent each small task. Issues will develop to include discussion of analysis methods and figures associated with each task.

The [Project/analysis Overview](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies_collaborative_project/projects/1) lists all the analysis tasks (as detailed in the issues) at various stages.

To start contributing to the code, make your own branch directly in this repository, edit away on your branch, and then submit pull requests between your branch and the master branch (or merge directly).

As we figure out the main results and develop the storyline, we can add to the [Results Summary here](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/blob/master/Results_summary.md) and [draft figure list for the paper here](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/blob/master/Figure_outline.md).
