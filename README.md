# easterlies_collaborative_project

A collaborative project to work on the ACCESS-OM2-01 Antarctic easterly perturbation simulations. This is a central repository where we can work on analysis scripts together, suggest new analysis directions, discuss figures etc.

## Project management
Each aspect of the project will be tracked through issues. Create an issue to represent each small task. Issue will develop to include discussion of analysis methods and figures associated with each task.

The [Project/analysis Overview](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies_collaborative_project/projects/1) lists all the analysis tasks (as detailed in the issues) at various stages.
