# Draft figure list

Note that there is detailed discussion of these figure in [this issue](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/37). Let's keep the discussion on that issue, and we can use this page as a summary of that discussion.

### NOTE: Each figure to have its own notebook.

(a) Climatological wind speed of the control experiment. Blue contour marks the zero divide line (poleward of which the perturbation is applied), black contour marks the 1000m isobath, and yellow boxes mark the DSW formation regions where wind was masked in the additional experiment. Climatological (b) eastward and (c) northward wind velocities with 1000m isobath contour (black).

This figure shows the primary response to the UP winds is an increase in DSW formation, enhanced AABW transport and a consequent decrease in age in the abyssal ocean. Leads to the question: "Why"?

## Hypotheses
We formulate 3 potential hypotheses to explain the increased DSW formation: 
1. The UP experiment has enhanced katabatic winds, which increase the surface water mass transformation in specific locations where coastal polynyas allow production of DSW;
2.  The UP experimental forcing acts to increase Ekman driven upwelling in a broad region across the Southern Ocean (in the perturbation region), increasing along-isopycnal transport in CDW layers and thus bringing more salt onto shelf. This small change in the salt balance enhances transformation of water into denser classes;
3.  The UP experiment increases northward sea ice transport of fresh water, which increases the salinity on the shelf and thereby enhances transformation rates (as per option 2).

Schematic figure of different hypotheses here??
  
## Local wind (katabatics) mechanism

Fig 4 - show results from "no katabatics" simulation.  Add error bar to control to show interannual (or 5 year avg) variability. **Adele**

This rules out hypothesis 1.

This section will also list some headline numbers to show that the no katabatics case is the same as UP, but we will just add these to the text.

## Upwelling and sea ice mechanisms

Firstly, explain in more detail how these mechanisms will operate using:

Fig 5 - Changes in buoyancy fluxes -- really to show that sea ice dominates. **Andy**

Suggestion for Andy here: I think the point here is to show for the UP and DOWN simulations: a) heat flux changes are insignificant compared to freshwater flux changes, and b) the changes in sea ice formation (i.e. melt diagnostic) dominate the change in the freshwater flux change. To do this, I think it would be best if all 3 of these things  have the same units, then can we show them all on the same plot? And keep zonal and meridional experiments until later.

![Figure5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26753100/140189989-79010f6f-3f1d-4634-94e2-946d170e5050.png)

Fig 6 - Ekman driven upwelling change - e.g. show change in Ekman pumping binned into surface density bins. **Paul**

This figure ideally shows that upwelling in CDW classes increases in UP, and that this is driven by the zonal component of the wind change not the meridional component. Would it make sense at this stage not to use the actual zonal/meridional experiments, but to just use the different components of the wind stress from the UP/control to show this?

Fig 7 - Sea ice advection changes - maps of change in sea ice concentration and ice velocity. **Paul**

The sea ice velocity plot shows that the it's the meridional component of the winds that are mostly responsible for the sea ice advection and therefore sea ice concentration changes.

## Motivates two additional experiments -- UPMeridional and UPZonal.
Fig 8 - SSH and DSW cross-slope transport in the UP, UPzonal and UPmeridional experiments **Julia**

<img width="700" alt="figure-8" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51519847/138806146-427d8efa-23bf-481f-ae42-9ba291547dec.jpg">

This shows that the DSW increase in UP is driven by the meridional component of the winds. This disproves hypothesis 2 and proves hypothesis 3 (based on what was shown about the dominance of zonal/meridional winds in Figures 6 and 7).

Do we need to include other figures here to expand on this argument more? Like the ice export across 1000m isobath in the meridional and zonal simulations? **Wilma**
