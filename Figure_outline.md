# Draft figure list

Note that there is detailed discussion of these figure in [this issue](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/37). Let's keep the discussion on that issue, and we can use this page as a summary of that discussion.

## Forcing perturbation

Fig 1 - experimental design (no CMIP6)

(a) Climatological wind speed of the control experiment with normalized wind vectors. Magenta contour marks the zero divide line (poleward of which the perturbation is applied), black contour marks the 1000m isobath, and red boxes mark the DSW formation regions where wind was masked in the additional experiment. (b) UP and (c) DOWN wind speed anomalies, with normalized wind vectors and 1000m isobath.

## Summary / motivation figure

Fig 2 - summary figure - SSH time series and bottom age map, maybe SWMT time series?

This figure shows the primary response to the UP winds is an increase in DSW formation, enhanced AABW transport and a consequent decrease in age in the abyssal ocean.

## General response
The explore the response of the shelf region to wind changes, we should first show a variety of standard metrics. Note that in most of these cases, we may need to show that the first-year response is different from the long-term response.

Fig 3 - Show the change in temperature on the shelf.

Fig 4 - Change in salinity on the shelf

Fig 5 - Change in Ekman pumping

Fig 6 - Change in sea ice.

Other potential figures include change in surface water mass transformation and enhanced ASC?

## Hypotheses
We formulate 3 potential hypotheses to explain the increased DSW formation: 
1. The UP experiment has enhanced katabatic winds, which increase the surface water mass transformation in specific locations where coastal polynyas allow production of DSW;
2.  The UP experimental forcing acts to increase Ekman driven upwelling in a broad region across the shelf, increasing along-isopycnal transport in CDW layers and thus bringing more salt onto shelf. This small change in the salt balance enhances transformation of water into denser classes;
3.  The UP experiment increases northward sea ice transport of fresh water, which increases the salinity on the shelf and thereby enhances transformation rates (as per option 2).
  
## Local wind (katabatics) mechanism

Fig 7 - no local wind simulation - show that this has very little difference to UP case.
e.g. time series of SWMT: <img width="400" alt="130855208-acd86fc8-2ed3-4e5c-aa71-f832b65e8594" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8506963/134439067-aa70264e-6a58-40e8-a852-dc1563e0c672.png">

or change in bottom age from UP (averaged over years 0-6, which is why this looks different to Fig 2, which is averaged over years 11-15):

## Upwelling mechanism

Fig 8 - Ekman driven upwelling change - e.g. show change in Ekman pumping binned into surface density bins, change in cross-isobath heat and salt transports in first 6 months before any DSW changes.

## Sea ice mechanism

Fig 9 - sea ice advection changes - e.g. maps of change in sea ice concentration and ice velocity, changes in ice export across 1000m isobath, perhaps include results of meridional only simulation to distinguish this mechanism from the upwelling mechanism.
