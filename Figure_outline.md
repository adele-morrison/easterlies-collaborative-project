# Draft figure list

Note that there is detailed discussion of these figure in [this issue](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/37). Let's keep the discussion on that issue, and we can use this page as a summary of that discussion.

## NOTE: Each figure to have its own notebook.

## Forcing perturbation

Fig 1 - experimental design (no CMIP6) - **Julia to update with streamplot version**

(a) Climatological wind speed of the control experiment with normalized wind vectors. Magenta contour marks the zero divide line (poleward of which the perturbation is applied), black contour marks the 1000m isobath, and red boxes mark the DSW formation regions where wind was masked in the additional experiment. (b) UP and (c) DOWN wind speed anomalies, with normalized wind vectors and 1000m isobath.

## Summary / motivation figure

Fig 2 - summary figure - SSH, Ekman and overturning time series;  (Actually, it's not clear to me exactly what the Ekman timeseries will entail...)

(As an aside, we have a running bet on how much the overturning at 55Â°S will change in the UP case. Paul: 10%, Wilma: 15%, Adele: 20%, Matt: 25%, Andy: 30%... TBD ...

Fig 3 - Maps showing Control, UP and DOWN bottom age (and salinity??) -- **Wilma is in charge here**

This figure shows the primary response to the UP winds is an increase in DSW formation, enhanced AABW transport and a consequent decrease in age in the abyssal ocean. Leads to the question: "Why"?

## Hypotheses
We formulate 3 potential hypotheses to explain the increased DSW formation: 
1. The UP experiment has enhanced katabatic winds, which increase the surface water mass transformation in specific locations where coastal polynyas allow production of DSW;
2.  The UP experimental forcing acts to increase Ekman driven upwelling in a broad region across the shelf, increasing along-isopycnal transport in CDW layers and thus bringing more salt onto shelf. This small change in the salt balance enhances transformation of water into denser classes;
3.  The UP experiment increases northward sea ice transport of fresh water, which increases the salinity on the shelf and thereby enhances transformation rates (as per option 2).
  
## Local wind (katabatics) mechanism

Fig 4 - show results from "no katabatics" simulation. This will be a bar chart showing SWMT derived from this timeseries: **Adele to make this one.**

This section will also list some headline numbers to show that the no katabatics case is the same as UP, but we will just add these to the text.

## Upwelling and sea ice mechanisms

Firstly, explain in more detail how these mechanisms will operate using:

Fig 5 - Changes in buoyancy fluxes -- really to show that sea ice dominates. **Andy to do this.**

Fig 6 - Ekman driven upwelling change - e.g. show change in Ekman pumping binned into surface density bins, change in cross-isobath heat and salt transports in first 6 months before any DSW changes. **Paul will do this**

Fig 7 - sea ice advection changes - e.g. maps of change in sea ice concentration and ice velocity, changes in ice export across 1000m isobath, perhaps include results of meridional only simulation to distinguish this mechanism from the upwelling mechanism. **Paul + Wilma to do this**

## Motivates two additional experiments -- UPMeridional and UPZonal.
Fig 8 - A repeat of Fig 2 but with the two new experiments?

Fig 9 - ?? temperature changes??

Fig 10 - ?? salinity changes ?? Or maybe these are now in Fig 3.

## Summary
Fig 11 -  maybe we can come up with a good schematic illustration???
