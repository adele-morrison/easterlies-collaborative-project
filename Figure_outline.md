# Draft figure list

Note that there is detailed discussion of these figure in [this issue](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/37). Let's keep the discussion on that issue, and we can use this page as a summary of that discussion.

## Forcing perturbation

Fig 1 - experimental design (no CMIP6)

This is just the climatological JRA winds. Julia is making something prettier.

## Summary / motivation figure

Fig 2 - summary figure - SSH time series and bottom age map, maybe SWMT time series?

## Hypotheses of different mechanisms

Propose 3 hypotheses: a) enhanced katabatics, b) more Ekman driven upwelling brings more salt onto shelf, c) enhanced northward sea ice advection reduces sea ice concentration.

## Local wind (katabatics) mechanism

Fig 3 - no local wind simulation - show that this has very little difference to UP case.
e.g.<img width="400" alt="130855208-acd86fc8-2ed3-4e5c-aa71-f832b65e8594" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8506963/134439067-aa70264e-6a58-40e8-a852-dc1563e0c672.png">

## Upwelling mechanism

Fig 4 - Ekman driven upwelling change - e.g. show change in Ekman pumping binned into surface density bins, change in cross-isobath heat and salt transports in first 6 months before any DSW changes.

## Sea ice mechanism

Fig 5 - sea ice advection changes - e.g. maps of change in sea ice concentration and ice velocity, changes in ice export across 1000m isobath, perhaps include results of meridional only simulation to distinguish this mechanism from the upwelling mechanism.

## Circulation and property changes

Somewhere do we want to show changes in temperature on the shelf, changes in ASC strength etc?
