# Draft figure list

Note that there is detailed discussion of these figure in [this issue](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/37). Let's keep the discussion on that issue, and we can use this page as a summary of that discussion.

## Forcing perturbation

Figure 1: Experimental design (enhancing/relaxation of climatological wind field)

a), b) climatological wind field in JRA (uas and vas) 

c), d) historical trends in JRA (uas and vas)

e), f) historical trends in CMIP6 models with JRA trends in red. These are calculated for different regions in the shelf.

*To improve: labels and marking the regions of e) and f) in the other panels*
