## A brief summary of results so far

Changes here are described for the UP perturbation, and unless otherwise specified, changes are largely symmetric for the UP and DOWN perturbations.

  * DSW formation increases (Evidence: [bottom age decreases](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/11#issuecomment-880288513) following bottom water pathways, [abyssal cooling](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/4#issuecomment-875259285) throughout the Southern Ocean,  [overflow velocities increase](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/7#issuecomment-876866344), [sea ice formation increases](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/10#issuecomment-877990121) etc).
  
  * Impacts of the lower cell overturning increase is seen in temp and salt on the shelf as follows: [SST warms, SSS salinifies, bottom salinity increases in DSW formation regions, bottom temperature cools in DSW formation regions](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/4#issuecomment-875259285), and the [shelf regions directly downstream of DSW formation sites warm at the bottom](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/16#issuecomment-884591714) due to less along-shelf connectivity from cold upstream waters and the change in vertical heat flux associated with the overturning increase.
  
  * [ASC strengthens](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/7#issuecomment-876146351).
  
  * [Sea ice thickness/concentration generally decreases](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/10#issuecomment-875248868) (except in the NE Weddell Sea and in the open ocean off the Amundsen). 
  
  * [Mixed layers deepen](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/14#issuecomment-877979016) in response to more wind-driven mixing in summer and more shelf convection in winter.
