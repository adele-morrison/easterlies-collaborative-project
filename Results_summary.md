# The story so far

## Forcing perturbation

To do: describe how we changed the winds and motivation for this.

### Comparison with reanalysis trends/CMIP6

To do: What are the easterly trends in reanalysis (overview of Hazel et al. 2019 and Julia's analysis)? How do the CMIP6 models compare with reanalysis over the historical period (i.e. how much do we trust them) and what are the easterly projections in the future?

**Historical period (1958 - 2015) mean wind fields:**
  * [JRA55-do has stronger winds than CMIP6 multimodel mean](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/12#issuecomment-897213042), particularly the meridional winds 

**Historical period (1958 - 2015) wind trends:**
 *  [Zonal wind trends](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/12#issuecomment-897213042) in JRA55 show the southwards shift of the westerlies *and intensification of the easterlies in some coastal regions*. These regions are adjacent to DSW formation sites. CMIP6 multimodel mean only captures the westerly trends, none of the more localized regions of intensification, and neither do the individual models.
 *  [Meridional wind trends](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/12#issuecomment-897213042) in JRA55-do show an increase of the off-shore winds in the western Weddell, Prydz Bay and Ross Seas. And a decrease of the off-shore winds in East Antarctica and East Ant. Peninsula. Of these, only the latter is present in CMIP6 multimodel mean. None of the individual models capture these trends either.

**Projected changes (end of 22nd century):**

[Projected changes in zonal and meridional winds](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/12#issuecomment-897282904) show:

  * The southward shift of the westerlies, affecting mostly the Antarctic Peninsula and East Antarctica.
  * Decrease of the off-shore winds in some regions (western Ross Sea, eastern Antarctic Peninsula, Amundsen Bellinghausen Seas) and increase in others (eastern Ross Sea, a portion of the Weddell, and Prydz Bay)

## Simulation responses

Changes here are described for the UP perturbation, and unless otherwise specified, changes are largely symmetric for the UP and DOWN perturbations.

  * DSW formation increases (Evidence: [bottom age decreases](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/11#issuecomment-880288513) following bottom water pathways, [abyssal cooling](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/4#issuecomment-875259285) throughout the Southern Ocean,  [overflow velocities increase](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/7#issuecomment-876866344), [sea ice formation increases](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/10#issuecomment-877990121) etc).
  
  * The increase in the lower cell overturning is associated with an increase in the upward heat flux from the abyss to the surface. This impacts temperature and salinity on the shelf as follows: [SST warms, SSS salinifies, bottom salinity increases in DSW formation regions, bottom temperature cools in DSW formation regions](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/4#issuecomment-875259285), and the [shelf regions directly downstream of DSW formation sites warm at the bottom](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/16#issuecomment-884591714) due to less along-shelf connectivity from cold upstream waters.
  
  * The [ASC strengthens](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/7#issuecomment-876146351).
  
  * [Sea ice thickness/concentration generally decreases](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/10#issuecomment-875248868) (except in the NE Weddell Sea and in the open ocean off the Amundsen). Is this due to more northerly ice advection, or SST warming?
  
  * [Mixed layers deepen](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/14#issuecomment-877979016) in response to more wind-driven mixing in summer and more shelf convection in winter.
  
  * A fast Ekman response is seen in the first year: [SSH increases over the shelf](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/23#issuecomment-893299741), and [SST cools](https://github.com/adele157/easterlies-collaborative-project/issues/4#issuecomment-880263337). However these responses are quickly overwhelmed with changes in the opposite direction driven by the increasing DSW.
  
  * To do: Add notes on Ekman pumping, sections of shelf that cool at the bottom (e.g. Amundsen).
