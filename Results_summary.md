# A brief summary of results so far

Changes here are described for the UP perturbation, and unless otherwise specified, changes are largely symmetric for the UP and DOWN perturbations.

  * DSW formation increases (Evidence: bottom age decreases following bottom water pathways, abyssal cooling throughout the Southern Ocean,  overflow velocities increase, sea ice formation increases etc).
  
  * Impacts of the lower cell overturning increase is seen in temp and salt on the shelf as follows: SST warms, SSS salinifies, bottom salinity in DSW formation regions increases, bottom temperature in DSW formation regions cools, the shelf regions downstream of DSW formation sites (i.e. WAP, downstream of Mertz and Prydz Bay, but not downstream of Ross Sea) warm due to less connectivity from cold upstream waters and the change in vertical heat flux associated with the overturning increase.
  
  * SST warms and SSS becomes more salty
