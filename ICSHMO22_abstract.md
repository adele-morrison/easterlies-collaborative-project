##Abstract:
Surface winds on the Antarctic continental shelf play a vital role in global climate by driving sea ice and seawater motion and modulating air-sea buoyancy fluxes. An analysis of CMIP models and reanalysis products reveals large uncertainties in the strength of these winds in historical and future climate. Experiments with a global, eddying ocean and sea ice model are conducted to explore the impact of different Antarctic coastal wind amplitudes on Southern Ocean climate. The meridional coastal wind component is identified as a key determinant of the model state by modulating the export of sea ice across the continental shelf and dense shelf water production around Antarctica.
